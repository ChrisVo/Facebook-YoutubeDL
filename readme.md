A django project acts as the backend for a facebook bot. The bot allows user to search for youtube videos through it. It also accepts the URL for a youtube video and uses quickreplies to provide choice to download audio or video. Writing "audio"/"video" in the message provides a link to download the audio/video.

To install dependencies, run the following command in terminal:

```sudo pip install -r requirements.txt```

This project is deployed on heroku. Provide your own verify-token and page access token if cloning.
